Hello there, this is Gonzalo!

At heart a mathematician, I have worked as a researcher in academia for some time. My research focused mainly in probabilistic combinatorics and related areas. In particular I have worked in additive combinatorics, random graph processes and Ramsey theory. 

The idea behind the blog (inspired by Lilian Weng's [blog](https://lilianweng.github.io)) is to document learning notes on subjects I have been recently learning about and to hopefully bring in my own perspective.

Please feel free to contact me regarding any typos/suggestions/references/etc. 

This will do for now.
