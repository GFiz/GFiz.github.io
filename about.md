Hello there, this is Gonzalo!
The idea behind the blog is to document learning notes on the subjects that I have been learning about and to hopefully bring in my own perspective. The idea to do this was inspired by Lilian Weng's blog.

Please feel free to contact me regarding any typos/suggestions/references/etc. 

This will do for now.
